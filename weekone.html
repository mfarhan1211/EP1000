                   <h2>Intro To Fablab Safety & Tools</h2>

                   <p>The objective of this lesson is to ensure that all students are given appropriate safety and health training related to their field of study.</p>
                   <h2>Emergency Procedures: </h2>

- For Ambulance call 995<br>
- For SCDF call 995<br>
- For Police call 999<br>
- For all emergencies and incident reporting call
SP Emergency hotline 6772-1234<br>

<h2> Proper Attire </h2>
1. Long hair must be tied up<br>
2. Keep adornment properly<br>
3. No loose items allowed (Hanging necklace)<br>
4. T-shirt, No loose attire, No long sleeve<br>
5. Long pants must be worn<br>
6. Hands must be free of adornment<br>

<hr>

<h2>  Types Of Mechanical Hazards</h2>

<h3> 1. Entanglement hazards</h3>
Entanglement arise when
loose clothing, hair or loose
item got caught with the
moving parts of a machine. <br>

<h3> 2. Cutting hazards</h3>
Cutting hazards are present in machines used to cut wood, metal or
other materials at the point of operation.
Machines with moving cutting elements are dangerous.
They can cause severe injury (eg. deep cuts, amputations) due to its
own momentum when they come into contact with a worker’s body.<br>

<h3> 3. Impact hazards </h3>
Impact hazards relate to objects that strike the human body, but
do not penetrate it. The severity of an impact hazard depends
on the speed, force and inertia of the moving machine part
during operation or upon ejection from the machine .<br>

<h3> 4. Shearing hazards</h3>
Parts of machines that move past each other or stationary
objects can cause a shear point resulting in a crushing or
cutting action.<br>

<h3>5. Crushing hazards</h3>
It is caused when part of the body is caught between either
two moving parts of machinery or a moving part and a
stationary object. <br>

<h3> 6. Draw-in hazards</h3>
Parts of machines that move past each other or stationary
objects can cause a shear point resulting in a crushing or
cutting action. <br>


<h3> 7. Friction and abrasion hazards </h3>
Friction burns and abrasions occurs when encountering rough
surfaces moving at high speed e.g. sanding machine, grinding wheel
etc. can cause abrasion injuries.<br>

<hr>

<h2>Non-Mechanical Hazards</h2>


<h3>1. Fall from Heights Hazards</h3>
When required to work at heights, fall can lead to
sprains or broken bones and in more serious
cases, head injuries or even death

<h3>2. Noise Hazards</h3>
Noise is often generated during machine operations and
work activities. Prolonged exposure to excessive noise can cause NID
( Noise-Induced Deafness ).

<h3>3. Electrical Hazards</h3>
Accidents involving contact with electricity can happen when an
electrical machine failed, electric circuits are overloaded or shortcircuited, or when one comes into contact with a live wire.

<h3>4. Heat-related Hazards</h3>
Contact with hot surfaces of machines can cause severe skin burns.

<h3>5. Chemical Hazards</h3>
Prolonged exposure through inhalation of
chemical mist or vapour, can cause poor
respiratory health.

<h3>6. Fatigue</h3>
Fatigue is tiredness leading to reduced
mental and physical performance that
can endanger safety and health.

<h2>Common Causes of Hands & Arms Injuries</h2>
1. Abrasion<br>
2. Temperature Extremes<br>
3. Cuts & Punctures<br>
4. Handling of Chemicals<br>
5. Electrical Shock<br>
6. Skin Infection<br>
7. Disease Or Contamination<br>

<h2>Five basic rules to prevent hand injuries</h2>
1. Keep all tools in good condition with regular<br>
maintenance.<br>
2. Use the right tool for the job.<br>
3. Examine each tool for damage before use and
do not use damaged tools.<br>
4. Operate tools according to the manufacturers’
instructions.<br>
5. Properly use of the appropriate PPE<br>

<hr>

<h2>Good Housekeeping Practices </h2>
1. Always return the tools back to their designated
positions in the tool racks after use.<br>
2. Always keep the workplace neat and orderly after
use.<br>
3. Always clear away the debris and chips off the
machines or workbenches after use.<br>
4. Always bring unused or leftover materials to the
recycle area.<br>
