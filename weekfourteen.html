                   <h3>Sensors</h3>
                   <p>Senors are devices which detect or measure a physical property and records, indicates, or otherwise responds to it.</p>
                   <p>In the broadest definition, a sensor is a device, module, machine, or subsystem whose purpose is to detect events or changes in its environment and send the information to other electronics, frequently a computer processor. A sensor is always used with other electronics.</p>
                   <h3>Types of Sensors</h3>

                   <li>Switches: In electronics, an electronic switch is an electronic component or device that can switch an electrical circuit, interrupting the current or diverting it from one conductor to another. Electronic switches are considered binary devices because they can be on or completely off. Some types of switches are toggle switch, pushbutton siwtch, slide switch and touch capacitative switch</li>
                   <br>
                   <li>Temperature, Humidity: The DHT22 is a basic, low-cost digital temperature and humidity sensor. It uses a capacitive humidity sensor and a thermistor to measure the surrounding air, and spits out a digital signal on the data pin (no analog input pins needed). It's fairly simple to use, but requires careful timing to grab data. </li>
                   <br>
                   <li>Distance: An ultrasonic sensor is an electronic device that measures the distance of a target object by emitting ultrasonic sound waves, and converts the reflected sound into an electrical signal. Ultrasonic waves travel faster than the speed of audible sound (i.e. the sound that humans can hear)</li>
<br>
                   <li>Motion Detection: When an object interrupts or alters the sensor's field, an electric pulse is sent to the embedded computer, which in turn interacts with the mechanical component. The most common type of active motion detector uses ultrasonic sensor technology; these motion sensors emit sound waves to detect the presence of objects.</li>
<br>
                   <li>Light Measurement & Detection: The light sensor is a passive devices that convert this “light energy” whether visible or in the infra-red parts of the spectrum into an electrical signal output.</li>
<br>
                   <li>Time: A real-time clock (RTC) is a computer clock (most often in the form of an integrated circuit) that keeps track of the current time. Although the term often refers to the devices in personal computers, servers and embedded systems, RTCs are present in almost any electronic device which needs to keep accurate time</li>
