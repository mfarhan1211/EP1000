                   <h2>Web Development</h2>

                   <p>I have chosen atom to be my main text editor to create HTML Websites.</p>
                   <p>In Week Two, we learned how to make HTML pages.</p>
                   <h2>HTML and CSS</h2>

                   <p>HTML provides the basic structure of sites, which is enhanced and modified by other technologies like CSS and JavaScript.<br>
                   CSS is used to control presentation, formatting, and layout.<br>
                   JavaScript is used to control the behavior of different elements.<br>
                   Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email.<br></p>

                   <h2>The basic structure of HTML</h2>
                   <td> <img src="images/basicstructurehtml.png" width="320" length="200" /></td>
                   <p> This is commonly used in a basic HTML website and other commands could be added to make the html website. Some examples are:</p>
                   <p>hr: Adds a horizontal line inside the page</p>
                   <p>br: Sends the paragraph to the next line</p>
                   <p>a href: Adds a link to different pages</p>
                   <p>p: Adds a paragraph to the webpage</p>

                   <hr>

                   <h2>CSS Files</h2>
                    <td> <img src="images/basicstructurecss.png" width="320" length="200" /></td>
                   <p>CSS files are a cascading style sheet (CSS) file used to format the contents of a webpage. It contains customized, global properties for how to display HTML elements. CSS files can define the size, color, font, line spacing, indentation, borders, and location of HTML elements.</p>
                   <p>Different parts of the HTML file is being divided into different parts and a CSS file is made to give designs and colors to the specific parts of the HTML file. The picture above is an example of different commands that can be used to decorate the HTML Website.</p>
